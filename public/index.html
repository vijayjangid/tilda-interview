      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <p>
        You need to build a react app that can display the user an overview of
        their day, based on meeting schedule and todos.

      <h1 id="functional-description">Functional Description</h1>
      <p>A user&#39;s calendar consists of two types of tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Meetings</li>
        <li>Todos</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Meetings happen at a specific scheduled time. Todos have a time estimate
        for how long they take to completion and due date.
      </p>
      <p>
        The calendar should be able to plan user&#39;s schedule based on these
        two types of task.
